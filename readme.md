# How Ariosto references the rimanti of the _Commedia_ in _Orlando Furioso_: 
# A comparative study conducted using computational tools


## Context
This project was developed as part of a Master's thesis in Italian literature and Digial Humanities from the university of Lausanne (UNIL), presented in January 2024. 

## Overview
This project aims to compare the rimanti (end-words of verses that cointain the rhymes) of the _Divine Commedy_ from Dante Alighieri and _Orlando Furioso_ from Ludovico Ariosto to ascertain how and in which percentage the ferrarese poet takes inspiration for his rhymes form the florentine one.

## Data
The text file of the _Divine Comedy_ was provided by expert Giacomo Stanga, who curated with Prof. Simone Albonico _La Divina Commedia. Rimario alfabetico. Rimario strutturale_, a collection of the rhymes used by Dante ordered in alphabetical and recurrency order.

The text file of _Orlando Furioso_ was downloaded from liberliber.it (https://www.liberliber.it/online/autori/autori-a/ludovico-ariosto/orlando-furioso-segre/), a digitalisation of the Mondadori edition curated by Cesare Segre.

## _Ottava_ and _terza rima_
The rhythmiy systems of _Orlando Furioso_ and the _Divine Commedy_ particularly lend themeselves to rythumic and lexic exchanges. Both are constituted of alternating groups of two and three rhyming words (as shown in the scheme below).
